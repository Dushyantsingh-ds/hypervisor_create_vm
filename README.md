# Install Hyper-V on Windows 10

## Install Hyper-V on Windows 10

Enable Hyper-V to create virtual machines on Windows 10.
Hyper-V can be enabled in many ways including using the Windows 10 control panel, PowerShell or using the Deployment Imaging Servicing and Management tool (DISM). This documents walks through each option.

Note: Hyper-V is built into Windows as an optional feature -- there is no Hyper-V download.

### Check Requirements
- Windows 10 Enterprise, Pro, or Education
- 64-bit Processor with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT).
- CPU support for VM Monitor Mode Extension (VT-c on Intel CPUs).
- Minimum of 4 GB memory.
- The Hyper-V role cannot be installed on Windows 10 Home.

Upgrade from Windows 10 Home edition to Windows 10 Pro by opening up Settings > Update and Security > Activation.

## Enable Hyper-V using PowerShell
Open a PowerShell console as Administrator.

```
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
```
If the command couldn't be found, make sure you're running PowerShell as Administrator.

When the installation has completed, reboot.

Enable Hyper-V with CMD and DISM
The Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM) helps configure Windows and Windows images. Among its many applications, DISM can enable Windows features while the operating system is running.

## To enable the Hyper-V role using DISM:

Open up a PowerShell or CMD session as Administrator.

```
DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /All /FeatureName:Microsoft-Hyper-V
```

## Enable the Hyper-V role through Settings
-Right click on the Windows button and select ‘Apps and Features’.
-Select Programs and Features on the right under related settings.
-Select Turn Windows Features on or off.
-Select Hyper-V and click OK.

## When the installation has completed you are prompted to restart your computer.
```
Restart-Computer
```

# Create your first virtual machine

Create a virtual machine and install its operating system.

We've been building new tools for creating virtual machines so the instructions have changed significantly over the past three releases.

## Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (Windows 10 version 1709)
In Fall Creators Update, Quick Create expanded to include a virtual machine gallery that can be launched independently from Hyper-V Manager.

To create a new virtual machine in Fall Creators Update:

Open Hyper-V Quick Create from the start menu.

![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/media/quick-create-start-menu.png)

Select an operating system or choose your own by using a local installation source.


![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/media/vmgallery.png)

If you want to use your own image to create the virtual machine, select Local Installation Source.
Select Change Installation Source.

![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/media/change-source.png)

Pick the .iso or .vhdx that you want to turn into a new virtual machine.
If the image is a Linux image, deselect the Secure Boot option.

![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/media/toggle-secure-boot.png)

Select "Create Virtual Machine"

That's it! Quick Create will take care of the rest.

## Windows 10 Creators Update (Windows 10 version 1703)


![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/media/quickcreatesteps_inked.jpg)

Open Hyper-V Manager from the start menu.

In Hyper-V Manager, Find Quick Create in the right hand Actions menu.

Customize your virtual machine.

- (optional) Give the virtual machine a name.
- Select the installation media for the virtual machine. You can install from a .iso or .vhdx file. If you are installing Windows in the virtual machine, you can enable Windows Secure Boot. Otherwise leave it unselected.
- Set up network. If you have an existing virtual switch, you can select in the network dropdown. If you have no existing switch, you will see a button to set up an automatic network, which will automatically configure a virtual network.
Click Connect to start your virtual machine. Don't worry about editing the settings, you can go back and change them any time.

You may be prompted to ‘Press any key to boot from CD or DVD’. Go ahead and do so. As far as it knows, you're installing from a CD.

Congratulations, you have a new virtual machine. Now you're ready to install the operating system.

Your virtual machine should look something like this:

# Create Vm Hypervsior
## Create a virtual machine by using Hyper-V Manager

- Open Hyper-V Manager.
- From the Action pane, click New, and then click Virtual Machine.
- From the New Virtual Machine Wizard, click Next.
- Make the appropriate choices for your virtual machine on each of the pages. For more information, see New virtual machine options and defaults in Hyper-V Manager later in this topic.
- After verifying your choices in the Summary page, click Finish.
- In Hyper-V Manager, right-click the virtual machine and select connect.
- In the Virtual Machine Connection window, select Action > Start.

## Create a virtual machine by using Windows PowerShell
- On the Windows desktop, click the Start button and type any part of the name Windows PowerShell.
- Right-click Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
- Get the name of the virtual switch that you want the virtual machine to use by using Get-VMSwitch. For example,
```
Get-VMSwitch  * | Format-Table Name
```

Use the New-VM cmdlet to create the virtual machine. See the following examples.
Existing virtual hard disk - To create a virtual machine with an existing virtual hard disk, you can use the following command where,

- Name is the name that you provide for the virtual machine that you're creating.
- MemoryStartupBytes is the amount of memory that is available to the virtual machine at start up.
- BootDevice is the device that the virtual machine boots to when it starts like the network adapter (NetworkAdapter) or virtual hard disk (VHD).
- VHDPath is the path to the virtual machine disk that you want to use.
- Path is the path to store the virtual machine configuration files.
- Generation is the virtual machine generation. Use generation 1 for VHD and generation 2 for VHDX. See Should I create a generation 1 or 2 virtual machine in Hyper-V?.
- Switch is the name of the virtual switch that you want the virtual machine to use to connect to other virtual machines or the network. See Create a virtual switch for Hyper-V virtual machines.
```
New-VM -Name <Name> -MemoryStartupBytes <Memory> -BootDevice <BootDevice> -VHDPath <VHDPath> -Path <Path> -Generation <Generation> -Switch <SwitchName>
```

For example:
```
New-VM -Name Win10VM -MemoryStartupBytes 4GB -BootDevice VHD -VHDPath .\VMs\Win10.vhdx -Path .\VMData -Generation 2 -Switch ExternalSwitch
```
This creates a generation 2 virtual machine named Win10VM with 4GB of memory. It boots from the folder VMs\Win10.vhdx in the current directory and uses the virtual switch named ExternalSwitch. The virtual machine configuration files are stored in the folder VMData.

New virtual hard disk - To create a virtual machine with a new virtual hard disk, replace the -VHDPath parameter from the example above with -NewVHDPath and add the -NewVHDSizeBytes parameter. For example,

```
New-VM -Name Win10VM -MemoryStartupBytes 4GB -BootDevice VHD -NewVHDPath .\VMs\Win10.vhdx -Path .\VMData -NewVHDSizeBytes 20GB -Generation 2 -Switch ExternalSwitch
```
New virtual hard disk that boots to operating system image - To create a virtual machine with a new virtual disk that boots to an operating system image, see the PowerShell example in Create virtual machine walkthrough for Hyper-V on Windows 10.

Start the virtual machine by using the Start-VM cmdlet. Run the following cmdlet where Name is the name of the virtual machine you created.
```
Start-VM -Name <Name>
```
For example:
```
Start-VM -Name Win10VM
```

Connect to the virtual machine by using Virtual Machine Connection (VMConnect).
```
VMConnect.exe
```
